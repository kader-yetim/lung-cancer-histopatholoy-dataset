# lung-cancer-histopatholoy-dataset

The Lung Cancer Pathology Dataset is a curated collection of H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of lung tissue, obtained from the Medical Pathology Department of Kocaeli University, Faculty of Medicine.

This dataset contains histopathological lung tissue WSI images categorized into **two main classes**:

- **Cancer**
- **NonCancer**

The **Cancer** class is further divided into three subtypes of lung cancer:

  - **ADENO** – Adenocarcinoma
  - **SCC** – Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  - **NOS** – Not Otherwise Specified

The dataset is designed for deep learning and medical image analysis research.
